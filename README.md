# home-security-project
A simple project for my personal home security.

## Install on Raspian/Linux
To run this project you will need to install `wiringPi`, `libcurl` with OpenSSH enabled and `libcurlpp`.
If you want to test this program in a general Linux enviroment, do not install `wiringpi` lib.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wiringpi
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo apt install libcurlpp-dev
```
